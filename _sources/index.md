# Foreword

This textbook accompanies the course "Basics of image processing" given in the second year of [master IRIV](https://www.master-iriv.fr/),
at the [University of Strasbourg](https://www.unistra.fr/).
The goal of the course and this textbook is to provide an overview of the main problems, tools and methods
encountered in digital image processing.
Each section of the textbook focuses on a specific problem, we were careful to write short and easy-to-read sections.
<!-- In addition to this, chapter [In a Nutshell](mathematical-optimization) gives some explanation of the tools
that are used in image processing but not specific to the domain, so we put them apart and are not too detailed. -->

Several examples and problems are given through programming exercises, gathered in chapter [Labs](labs:lab1).
The programming exercises are with Python which is free and now used by many communities (medicine, astronomy, biology...).
To do the exercises on your personal computer, you must install Python and Jupyter Lab, as explained on page [](python).

For french-speakers, a [glossary](glossary) lists the french translation of the technical terms used in the textbook.

This textbook is written with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and is accessible everywhere from a computer, tablet or phone.
Nevertheless, it can be downloaded or printed.
