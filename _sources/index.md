# Basics of image processing

Image processing is the science of manipulating digital images by computer means.
This includes methods and algorithms to modify an image (resizing, filtering, registration...),
improve the visual quality of an image (deblurring, denoising...)
or
analyze the information contained in an image (Fourier analysis, contour detection...),
among others.

This textbook accompanies two courses of image processing given at the [University of Strasbourg](https://www.unistra.fr/)
and are associated with programming exercices.

The goal of this textbook is to provide an overview of the main problems, tools and methods encountered in digital image processing.
Each section of the textbook focuses on a specific problem,
we were careful to write short and easy-to-read sections.
<!-- In addition to this, chapter [In a Nutshell](mathematical-optimization) gives some explanation of the tools
that are used in image processing but not specific to the domain, so we put them apart and are not too detailed. -->

For French speakers, a [glossary](glossary) lists the French translation of the technical terms used in the textbook.

This textbook is written with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and is accessible anywhere from a computer, tablet or phone.
