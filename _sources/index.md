# Foreword

Image processing is the science of manipulating digital images by computer means.
This includes methods and algorithms to modify an image (resizing, filtering, registration...),
improve the visual quality of an image (deblurring, denoising...)
or
analyze the information contained in an image (Fourier analysis, contour detection...),
among others.

This textbook accompanies the course "Basics of image processing" given in the second year of the [master IRIV](https://www.master-iriv.fr/) program
at the [University of Strasbourg](https://www.unistra.fr/).
The goal of the course and this textbook is to provide an overview of the main problems, tools and methods
encountered in digital image processing.
Each section of the textbook focuses on a specific problem,
we were careful to write short and easy-to-read sections.
<!-- In addition to this, chapter [In a Nutshell](mathematical-optimization) gives some explanation of the tools
that are used in image processing but not specific to the domain, so we put them apart and are not too detailed. -->

Several examples and problems are given through programming exercises, gathered in chapter [Labs](labs:lab1).
The programming exercises need Python which is free and now used by many communities (medicine, astronomy, biology...).
To do the exercises on your own computer, you must install Python and Jupyter Lab, as explained on the page [](python).

For French speakers, a [glossary](glossary) lists the French translation of the technical terms used in the textbook.

This textbook is written with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and is accessible anywhere from a computer, tablet or phone.
Nevertheless, it can be downloaded or printed.
To do that, save it to PDF by clicking on the icon &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-download"></i>&nbsp; in the top-right corner of the page.

Lastly, this course comes with [this Moodle page](https://moodle3.unistra.fr/course/view.php?id=7653) (accessible only to my students).
