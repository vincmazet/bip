    "A binary image is an image whose pixels take only two values, typically 0 and 1\n",
    "(but ​​it can be 0 or 255, False or True, black or white, etc.).\n",
    "A binary image can result from a segmentation, and the techniques presented in this chapter can help to improve the result.\n",

    "So, we consider that the images contain objects (represented by white pixels) on a background (black pixels),\n",

    "the basic operators of mathematical morphology ([dilation](C:binary:dilation) and [erosion](C:binary:erosion),\n",
    "and their combination [opening](C:binary:opening) and [closing](C:binary:closing)) are presented.\n",
    "Multiple tools have been created from these operators, we focus on four of these tools:\n",

    "and [skeleton](C:binary:skeleton).\n",
    "Finally, we deal with [measuring the geometric characteristics](binary:measure) of binary objects."
