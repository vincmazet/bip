    "Image interpolation is a tool used extensively when an image is mapped into a predefined geometry,\n",
    "by using transformations such as rescaling, translating, shrinking or rotating.\n",
    "Applications arise in many domains:\n",
    "creating panoramas in photography, return a cartographic reference in remote sensing,\n",
    "or align images on anatomical references in medical imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consequence of a geometric transformation on an image\n",
    "is that the coordinates of the pixels in the input and and the output image no longer coincide.\n",
    "Thus the pixel intensities in the output image have to be calculated.\n",

    "As shown by **Eq. (10.36)**, the transfer function of an ideal interpolation kernel is a rectangular (box) function\n",
    "which is zero outside the wave numbers that can be represented.\n",

    "1. Enlarge the matrix of the Fourier transformed image.\n",
    "   If an $M \\times M$ matrix is increased to an $M' \\times M'$ matrix,\n",
    "   the image in the spatial domain is also increased to an $M' \\times M'$ image.\n",
    "   Because of the reciprocity of the Fourier transform, the image size remains unchanged.\n",
    "   Only the spacing between pixels is decreased,\n",
    "   resulting in a higher spatial resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fill the padded area in the Fourier space with zeroes\n",
    "   and compute an inverse Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, this procedure results in a perfectly interpolated image.\n",
    "Unfortunately, it has three drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Fourier transform of a ﬁnite image\n",
    "   implies a cyclic repetition of the image in the spatial and Fourier domain.\n",
    "   Thus, the convolution performed by the Fourier transform is cyclic.\n",
    "   This means that at the edge of the image,\n",
    "   convolution continues with the image on the opposite side.\n",
    "   As the real world is not periodic and interpolation masks are large,\n",
    "   this may lead to signiﬁcant distortions of the interpolation\n",
    "   even at quite large distances from the edges of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Fourier transform can be computed eﬃciently\n",
    "   only for a specified number of values for $M'$.\n",
    "   Best known are the fast radix-2 algorithms that can be applied\n",
    "   only to images of the size $M' = 2^{N'}$.\n",
    "   Therefore, the Fourier transform-based interpolation is slow for numbers $M'$ \n",
    "   that cannot be expressed as a product of many small factors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. As the Fourier transform is a global transform, it can be applied only to scaling.\n",
    "   According to the generalized similarity theorem,\n",
    "   it could also be applied to rotation and affine transforms.\n",
