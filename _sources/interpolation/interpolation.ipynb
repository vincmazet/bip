The intensities of the new pixels are then the values ​​of the function at the location where these pixels are located.

Ce rééchantillonnage apparaît par exemple lors du redimensionnement d'une image (cas d'un zoom), au moment de la rotation d'une image ou dans tous les cas où la géométrie de l'image est modifiée. L'idée est de choisir une fonction qui modélise l'évolution spatiale des intensités des pixels et de régler ses paramètres grâce aux intensités des pixels existants. Les intensités des nouveaux pixels sont alors les valeurs de la fonction à l'endroit où se trouvent ces pixels.

    "   This means that at the edge of the image,\n",
    "   convolution continues with the image on the opposite side.\n",

    "   this may lead to signiﬁcant distortions of the interpolation\n",

    "3. As the Fourier transform is a global transform, it can be applied only to scaling.\n",
