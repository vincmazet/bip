# Conclusion

To conclude, an histogram is a graphical representation of the intensity distribution in a digital image.
It plots the number of pixels for each intensity:
the horizontal axis represents the intensities and the vertical axis represents the number of pixels in each intensity.
Therefore, the histogram indicates whether an image is rather dark or rather light.
By applying a transformation on an histogram, one can change the pixel intensities of the image.
The histogram will be used especially for [Segmentation](C:segmentation:intro).
