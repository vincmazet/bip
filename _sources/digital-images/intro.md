# Introduction

<!-- workflow pour illustrer -->

We present in this chapter the process to create a digital image to be displayed on a screen and manipulated by computers.
A discussion about the eye anatomy is also given since it is essential to make devices able to reproduce the human vision.

A digital image is a visual representation of a numerical array that meassures a physical phenomenon.
Therefore, a digital image can be seen as an array of numbers, on which mathematical operations can be done.
The array is not imposed to be of two dimensions: it can be of many dimensions, depending of the type of image acquisition.
The acquisition devices are never perfect and introduce several modifications of the image, such as subsampling, quantization, noise, etc.
Then we see how to display an image (i.e. an array of number) into a visual representation, especially the link between the numbers and the colors.
At last, we introduce some very simple processings with arithmetic operations.
