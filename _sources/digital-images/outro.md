# Conclusion

A digital image is essentially an array that associates at each coordinate $(m,\,n,\,\dots) \in \mathbb{N}^d$ a set of intensities $\{i_1,\dots,i_B\} \in \mathbb{R}^B$.
Typically, images are two-dimensional ($d=2$) and can be either grayscale ($B=1$) or RGB ($B=3$).
Fundamental image processing operations involve basic array manipulations (addition,subtraction or ddivision).

RGB images reproduces the colors perceived by the human visual system.
This is achieved by employing a red--green--blue Bayer filter during acquisition,
and using red, green, and blue luminophores for display on screen.
This reproduces the three types of cones of the Human eye.

The digitization of a natural image involves both sampling and quantization,
processes that can introduce distortions, such as the moir√© effect.
additional distortions that can affect images are noise and blur.

To display an image, a colormap must be defined in order to associate a gray level or a color to each intensity.
Some colormaps are very interesting for their ability to enhance specific image details.
