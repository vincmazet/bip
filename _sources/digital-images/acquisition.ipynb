    "<!-- compressive sensing -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step of digital image formation is digitization,\n",
    "which is both the sampling and quantization of the observed scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling corresponds to mapping a continuous scene onto a discrete grid.\n",
    "This is naturally done by the matrix of pixels.\n",
    "Sampling a continuous image leads to a loss of information.\n",
    "Intuitively, it is clear that sampling reduces resolution:\n",
    "structures at about the scale of the sampling distance and finer will be lost.\n",
    "Thus the number of pixels on the sensor, directly related to the sampling, is crucial.\n",
    "Besides, significant distortions occur when sampling an image with fine structures,\n",
    "as seen in {numref}`F:digital-images:moire`.\n",

    "right: image of size 595×595.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of distortion is called the moiré effect.\n",
    "The same phenomenon exists in signal processing and is called aliasing.\n",
    "To avoid the moiré effect, one has to satisfy the sampling theorem\n",
    "which imposes a maximal sampling step in function of the frequencies present in the image.\n",
    "In practice, one prefers to put an optical low-pass filter before the sensor\n",
    "to vanish the high frequencies responsible for the moiré effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization corresponds to mapping the continuous light intensities to a finite set of numbers.\n",
    "Typically, image are quantized into 256 gray values; then, each pixel then occupies one byte (8 bits).\n",
    "The reason for assigning 256 gray values to each pixel is\n",
    "not only because it is well adapted to the architecture of computers,\n",
    "but also because it is good enough to give humans\n",
    "the illusion of a continuous change in gray values.\n",
    "\n",

    "256, 16, 4, and 2 gray levels.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, quantization naturally introduces errors on the intensities.\n",
    "If the quantization levels are equally spaced with a distance $d$\n",
    "and all gray values are equally probable,\n",
    "the standard deviation of the quantification error is lower than $0.3d$\n",
    "[[Jähne 2005, p. 243]](B:digital-images:Jahne2005).\n",
    "For most common applications, the error is sufficiently low to be acceptable.\n",
    "But some applications, such as medical imaging or astronomy,\n",
    "require a finer resolution and, in consequence, use more than 256 gray levels."

    "Despite the high quality of an imaging system,\n",
    "a point in the observed scene is not imaged onto a point in the image space,\n",
    "but onto a more or less extended area with varying intensities.\n",
    "The function that describes the imaging of a point is an essential feature of the imaging system and is called the point spread function or PSF (French: _fonction d'étalement du point_).\n",
    "Generally, the PSF is assumed to be independent of the position.\n",
    "Then, the imaging system can be treated as a linear shift-invariant system,\n",
    "which is mathematically described as a convolution (see the [dedicated chapter](filtering:convolution)).\n",
    "Sometimes, an imaging system is described not by its PSF\n",
