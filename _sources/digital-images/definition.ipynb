    "## Diversity of images\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital images can be categorized in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension number $d$\n",
    "\n",
    "Common images, such as photographs, are 2D (2-dimensional) images while other images lie in more than two dimensions.\n",
    "A 3D image, as seen in MRI scans, is often referred to as a \"3D image\" or \"cube\".\n",
    "A 1D image is essentially a signal.\n",
    "The elements constituting a 2D image are called _pixels_ (\"picture element\"),\n",
    "and those constituting a 3D image are called _voxels_ (\"volume element\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension heterogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "In common 2D images, the two dimensions are spatial dimensions.\n",
    "However, the dimensions can represent another physical domain and be different.\n",
    "For instance, a video can be seen as a 2D+$t$ image (two spatial dimensions, one temporal dimension);\n",
    "a functional MRI sequence can be seen as a 3D+$t$ image (three spatial dimensions, one temporal dimension);\n",
    "and a [hyperspectral image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging)\n",
    "is a 2D+$\\lambda$ image (two spatial dimensions, plus a third dimension depending on the wavelength).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element dimension $B$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each element within an image can be scalar ($B=1$) or vector ($B>1$).\n",
    "For instance, pixels in a 2D grayscale image gather only one value: the gray intensity.\n",
    "Pixels in photography gather three values (the intensity of red, green and blue).\n",
    "Images from the [Pl√©iades constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades_(satellite)) are RVB--IR: they gather four values (red, green, blue, and infrared).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element intensity set\n",
    "\n",
    "Common images have pixel intensities within the range $\\{0,1,\\dots,255\\}$,\n",
    "but binary images have values in $\\{0,1\\}$.\n",
    "Most of the time, the intensities are assumed to be real numbers."
