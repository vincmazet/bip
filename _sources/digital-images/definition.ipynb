    "## Diversity of images\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital images can be differentiated in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension number $d$\n",
    "\n",
    "Common images (like photography) are 2D (2-dimensional) images whereas some other images lie in more than two dimensions.\n",
    "A 3D image, like in MRI, is often called \"3D image\" or \"cube\".\n",
    "A 1D image is actually a signal.\n",
    "The elements constituting a 2D image are called _pixels_ (for \"picture element\"),\n",
    "and the one constituting a 3D image are called _voxels_ (for \"volume element\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension heterogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "In common 2D images, the two dimensions are both spatial dimensions.\n",
    "But the dimensions may represent another physical domain and be different.\n",
    "For example, a video can be seen as a 2D+$t$ image (two spatial dimensions, one temporal dimension),\n",
    "an MRI sequence can be seen as a 3D+$t$ image (three spatial dimensions, one temporal dimension),\n",
    "and a [hyperspectral image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging)\n",
    "is a 3D+$\\lambda$ image (two spatial dimensions, plus a third dimension depending on the wavelength).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element dimension $B$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each element of an image can be scalar or vector.\n",
    "For example, the pixels in a 2D grayscale image gather only one value (the gray intensity).\n",
    "The pixels in photography gather three values (the intensity of red, green and blue).\n",
    "The images from the [Pl√©iades constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades_(satellite)) are RVB--IR,\n",
    "therefore they gather four values (red, green, blue, and infrared).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element intensity set\n",
    "\n",
    "Common images have pixel intensities in the range $\\{0,1,\\dots,255\\}$,\n",
    "but a binary image has values in $\\{0,1\\}$.\n",
    "Often, the intensities are supposed to be real."
