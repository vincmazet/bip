    "\n",
    "* The convolution is distributive with respect to the addition: &nbsp;\n",
    "$g*(h_1+h_2) = g*h_1 + g*h_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The convolution is bilinear: &nbsp;\n",
    "$\\alpha (g*h) = (\\alpha g) * h = g * (\\alpha h)$ &nbsp; (with $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{C}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The convolution is associative: &nbsp;\n",
    "$h_1*(h_2*h_3) = (h_1*h_2)*h_3$.\n",

    "(C:convolution-boundaries)=\n",
    "## Boundaries effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution formula is not defined on the boundaries of the image:\n",
    "as an example, computing $f_{1,1}$ in {numref}`F:convolution:sketch` requires the value of $g_{0,0}$ which is not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, one has to make assumptions about the pixel values outside the image.\n",
    "{numref}`F:convolution:boundaries-hypotheses` shows an image with some possibilities to consider the external pixels, and {numref}`F:convolution:boundaries-results` shows the convolution of these images by a Gaussian.\n",

    "Results of the convolution with the same image.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One can see on the {numref}`F:convolution:boundaries-results` that the three convolutions are basically identical:\n",
    "only the pixels near the boundaries may be different (darker or brighter on this example).\n",
    "Anyway, there is no perfect choice to set the pixels outside the image, and each choice yields some errors.\n",
    "Also, the best thing is to ensure when acquiring the image that the objects of interest are far from the edges\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, note that the wrapping hypothesis yields a _circular convolution_.\n",
    "This is also the result given by a multiplication in the Fourier domain (see [](filtering:fourier)).\n",

    "## Separable Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "A separable convolution is when the convolution kernel $h$ can be written as the convolution of two 1D filters (say $h_1$ and $h_2$) defined along the two axes.\n",
