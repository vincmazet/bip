# Filtering

The operation of filtering consists in selecting some frequencies in the images.
Especially, we distinguish low-pass filtering which preserves only the low frequencies ({numref}`F:lowpass`)
and high-pass filtering which preserves only the high frequencies ({numref}`F:highpass`).

```{figure} lowpass.svg
:name: "F:lowpass"

Example of low-pass filtering: only the low frequencies are kept.
Top row: spatial domain, bottom row: amplitude of the DFT.
```

```{figure} highpass.svg
:name: "F:highpass"

Example of high-pass filtering: only the high frequencies (i.e. the sudden changes in the intensities) are kept.
```

In these examples, the first row shows the image in the spatial domain,
thus the filtered image is the convolution of the original image and the kernel.
The second row shows the same information in the Fourier domain,
thus the DFT of the filtered image is the multiplication (point to point) of the DFT of the original image and the kernel.
