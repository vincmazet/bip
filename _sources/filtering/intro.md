# Introduction



The two-dimensional Fourier transform is the extension of the well knwon Fourier transform to images {ref}`[Jahne 2005, section 2.3] <C:biblio>`.
We recall that the Fourier transform decomposes a signal into a sum of sinusoids,
thus highlighting the frequencies contained in this signal.
