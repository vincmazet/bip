# Introduction

Feature detection (French: _détection de caractéristiques_) concerns the search for specific marks in an image,
such as edges or corners of the objects, geometric shapes (lines, circles...), particular patterns, and so on.
In this way, feature detection extracts high-level information from the image.
Many applications need feature detection,
for example: measuring the detected objects, recognizing a specific object or classifying images according to their characteristics.
