    "```{dropdown} Solution\n",
    "A Full HD video is characterized by images of size 1920 Ã— 1080, each of the three channels (RGB) is coded with 1 byte, and there are 50 frames per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "One second contains 1920 Ã— 1080 Ã— 3 Ã— 50 = 311 040 000 bytes, or around 311 Mb.\n",
    "Thus, a DVD (4,7 Gb) can store only 15 seconds of a movie... ðŸ˜²\n",
    "You would need more than 600 DVDs to watch a movie...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows the need for image compression!\n",
    "The purpose of image compression is to encode the _information_ contained in the image with fewer bytes than the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, but how to quantify information?\n",
    "In 1948, [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) proposed that an image or a message is very informative if it is unlikely.\n",
    "It is still the mathematical definition of information today.\n",
    "\n",
    "We distinguish two kinds of compression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* With [](compression:lossless), no information is lost during compression,\n",
    "  _i.e._ the original image and the compressed image are perfectly identical.\n",
    "  It is possible to reach a compression ratio up to 1/10\n",
    "  (the size in bytes of the compressed image is 1/10 of the original one).\n",
    "  \n",
    "* In [](compression:lossy), we accept to lose information during compression\n",
    "  (while ensuring that the original image remains close to the original one).\n",
    "  The compression ratio can reach up to 1/100!"
