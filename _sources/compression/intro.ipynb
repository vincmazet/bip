    "A Full HD video is characterized by images of size 1920 Ã— 1080, each of the three channels (RGB) is coded with 1 byte, and there are 50 frames per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "One second contains 1920 Ã— 1080 Ã— 3 Ã— 50 = 311 040 000 bytes, or around 311 Mb.\n",
    "Thus, a DVD (4,7 Gb) can store only 15 seconds of a movie... ðŸ˜²\n",

    "This example shows the need for image compression!\n",
    "The purpose of image compression is to encode the _information_ contained in the image with fewer bytes than the original image.\n",

    "  _i.e._ the original image and the compressed image are perfectly identical.\n",
    "  It is possible to reach a compression ratio up to 1/10\n",
    "  (the size in bytes of the compressed image is 1/10 times the original one).\n",

    "How many bytes are needed to code one second of Full HD video? [...] You would need more than 600 DVDs to watch a movieâ€¦ Cette exemple illustre bien l'importance de la compression de donnÃ©es, et en l'occurrence la compression d'image : l'objectif est de coder la mÃªme information ou presque que l'image originale mais en utilisant le moins d'espace mÃ©moire possible. Claude Shannon in 1948 a definition of to measure the quantity of information: he proposed to consider that an image or a message is very informative if it is unlikely. It is still the mathematical definition for information. We distinguish two kinds of compression: - With Lossless compression, no information is lost during compression, i.e. the original image and the compressed image are perfectly identical. It is possible to reach a compression ratio up to 1/10 (the size in bytes of the compressed image is 1/10 times the original one). - In Lossy compression, we accept to lose information during compression (while ensuring that the original image remains close to the original one). The compression ratio can reach 1/100! -->"
