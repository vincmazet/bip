# Conclusion

The goal of image compression is to minimize the storage needs while keeping a good visual quality of the image.
Two kinds of compression exist: lossless (BMP, GIF, PNG...) and lossy (JPEG).
While lossy compression is attractive, it should be used carefully because some images, like cartoons or logos,
may be visually impacted by the compression.
