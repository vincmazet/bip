    "\n",
    "Image compression consists of reducing the memory size of an image while modifying it as little as possible to maintain a satisfactory quality.\n",
    "What is \"satisfactory\" depends on the application: the goal is not the same for a consumer photograph and a medical image.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of image compression.\n",
    "Lossless compression (_e.g._ BMP, GIF, PNG...) does not change the image but the compression gain is limited.\n",
    "On the contrary, lossy compression (_e.g._ JPEG) is able to reach a high compression rate but may lose information;\n",
    "this is why lossy compression should not be used for images with few details, like cartoons or logos."
