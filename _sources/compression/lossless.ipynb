    "Here are two examples of lossless image compression.\n",

    "## Run-length encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "RLE (run-length encoding) replaces a sequence of pixels of the same color with the number of pixels in that sequence.\n",
    "Therefore, the image {numref}`F:compression:rle` needs 9 bytes to be stored without any compression.\n",
    "By reading the image column after column, the bytes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 255 & 128 & 128 \\end{pmatrix}.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We see 3 pixels with intensity 0, 4 pixels with intensity 255, and 2 pixels with intensity 128.\n",
    "Thus the image is encoded in RLE with only 6 bytes:\n",

    "\n",
    "The LZW algorithm (Lempel-Ziv-Welch, 1984) is an improvement of the LZ78 algorithm (1978).\n",
    "It is used in format such as GIF or TIFF.\n",
    "In short, the principle is to build a dictionary where the \"words\" are groups of pixels and to assign a code to each group.\n",
    "The dictionary is built during the compression stage and depends on the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    " The algorithm is the following one:\n",
    " Initialize the dictionary with all the possible intensities\n",
    " For each pixel:\n",
    "   Look to the longest sequence in the dictionary that starts at this pixel\n",
    "   Replace this sequence with the corresponding code\n",
    "   Add to the dictionary the sequence followed by the next pixel -->\n"
